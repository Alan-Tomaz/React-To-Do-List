# To Do List

### A To Do List website created with the React Lib

The site allows you to create a list of tasks with categories, where you can manage them in different ways. It's possible:
- Add Tasks;
- Remove Tasks;
- Change the status of tasks - to "complete" or "incomplete";
- Filter tasks by name;
- Filter tasks by category (complete or incomplete);
- Filter tasks in alphabetical order;

The site was created using the react library with Vite.

To create the project, tools such useState Hook and concepts such as conditional rendering, State Lift and componentization were used.

The website was created following the tutorial from the channel **[Hora de Codar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVEVrigByKY&t=35s)**.
